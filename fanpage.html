		<h2>Beatles Facts</h2>

		<p>
			The beatles were probably a band. I have some feelings about them. I listened to a song once and they maybe wrote it.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were 4 of them. I'm guessing one sang, another played the drums, a third played an instrument, and the last probably had great hair. Its obvious which was whome based on the picture.
